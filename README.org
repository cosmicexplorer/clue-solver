Because I'm a sore loser.

* TODO tasks [1/3]
- [X] read config [2/2]
  - [X] get all cards with names (same for all games)
  - [X] get ~k_i~ for each player
- [ ] make something to generate ~deriving~ clauses for simple newtype wrappers
  - see [[file:src/Lib.hs][Lib.hs]]
- [ ] implement ops [0/3]
  - [ ] known-card
  - [ ] failed-query
  - [ ] successful-query

* repl
1. read in query (no player number)
   - then read in failures until success
2. display known cards of every player

*** Query format
~q:<card_1>,<card_2>,...~

*(realistically, there will only be 3 cards in each query)*

~<card_i>~ is the string representation of a card, read from ~getCardTags~

*** failure/success format
- failure :: ~f:<num>~
- success (card not known) :: ~s:<num>~
  - i.e. if you did not make the query
- success (card known) :: ~c:<num>~
  - i.e. if you did make the query

Where ~<num>~ is the number of the player responding to the query.

*** display known format
~d~

* future
- suggest query
  - suggestion includes a room, which requires knowledge of the game board and probabilities on getting to each point
